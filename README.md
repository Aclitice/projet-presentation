# projet-presentation
There are some project that i have done, Mainly to let the admissons officers understand my capabilities.
These projects are not all presented in my CV, so i explain a little over here.
I think you are interested for me or my projects that i have done, because you are here. 
I say Thank you so much for give me a chance to show.

let us get the business.
There are 3 information system, visualization, library and trading system.
I think the trading system is the most complex. So you can see first if you have no more time.
I have used Vue frame to create Web, and connect Django frame. it can show my development skills.
if you wanna run it, open the project,open the database(maybe you need to migrate the database)
first, run the web,use order word "npm run serve"
second, run the django use order words "manage.py runserver"
the administrator name is admin, and password is admin123, or you can create a new one to try, but in Django frame,only admin can watch the data of trade commodities
or delete it

And then the project visualization show the other frame in python : Flask.
in this project, i have used crawler to obtain some date that is in the document .ipynb in zip.and you can run the app.py to show the page after you run the crawler.

finaly, the others like titanic, Library. that's my exercise projet in some courses. But it also used some cllassic models, such as bayes, decision tree,ANN,k-means.

If you are not the admissions officers of university, you find here and you wanna take my things. 
Don't forget tell me.
